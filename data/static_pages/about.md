# About

We are a couple of Muslims passionate about creating fun (and educational) digital games, and portraying Islam positively in the media, in our spare time, since 2012. You can read more about why this is important in our [blog post on this topic](https://www.deengames.com/blog/2019/integrating-religion-into-games.html).

Keeping our games free (and open-source) is part of our core values. We strive to create games that are enjoyable and fun, not ad-riddled games that are optimized to empty your wallet. You can find our projects [â€‹here on GitHub](https://github.com/deengames).

We need your support. If you have the time, consider helping out for a project -- everything from feedback to play-testing, artwork, programming, or just spreading the word about games you like.

If you want to help out or just reach out, you can [drop us an email](mailto:nightblade@deengames.com). We'd love to hear from you.

If you have interest in having a say in our projects, you can be part of our subscription site. [Read more about it on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/DeenGames).
