# About

Deen Games started with a simple idea: to represent the voice and values and culture of Muslims and Islam in games. For too long, we've been falsely portrayed as villains in media.

But Deen Games became so much more than that:

- We create fun, engaging alternatives to non-Islamic games.
- We develop educational kids games about math, science, and other (STEM and non-STEM) topics.
- We develop Islamic games that cover various aspects in depth and breadth.
- We showcase our voice, our values, and our culture to the media.
- We invite players to think from another perspective and learn more about Islam
- We teach Muslims about their religion.

We need your support. If you have the time, consider helping out for a project -- everything from feedback to play-testing, artwork, programming, there's no end to what we need!

If you want to help out or just reach out, you can [drop us an email](mailto:nightbladecodes@gmail.com). We'd love to hear from you.

Alternatively, not everyone has the time, motivation, or talents to help with games. With financial support, we can hire help and make more, better games, faster. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/DeenGames">Click here to read more about it on Patreon</a>.
