# About

Deen Games is a hub for our Islamic and educational games. Our goal is to raise the bar, and provide people with an example of how games can be used to impart good to the masses.

We work in small teams (usually of one or two), crafting games in between all our other responsibilities.

We always need help. If you have the time, consider helping out for a project or two â€” everything from feedback and comments to play-testing, artwork, and sound, all the way up to commitment to and across projects for development, play-testing, or art/sound creation. If you're interested in helping out, hit up our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/deengames) or [drop me an email](mailto:ashes999@yahoo.com). We'd love to hear from you. No help is too trivial!

We understand that not everyone has the time, motivation, or talents to help with games. Consider supporting us financially -- even a couple of dollars a month take us closer to our dream of making quality games, full-time.
