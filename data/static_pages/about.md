# About

We are a shifting team of 1-4 Muslims passionate about creating fun (and educational) digital games, and portraying Islam positively in the media, in our spare time, since 2012. You can read more about religion in games, and why this is important to us, in our [blog post on this topic](https://www.deengames.com/blog/2019/integrating-religion-into-games.html).

Keeping our games free (and open-source) is part of our core values. We strive to create games that are enjoyable and fun (and often, short), not grindy ad-riddled games that are optimized to empty your wallet. You can find our projects [â€‹here on GitHub](https://github.com/deengames). While many of our newer games are commercial, we still release open-source games from time to time.

If you have any questions/comments, or would like to help out or just reach out, you can [find us on Discord](https://discord.gg/5D6XS3b) or [drop me an email](mailto:nightblade@deengames.com). I'd love to hear from you.

If you have interest in having a say in our projects, you can be part of our subscription site. [Read more about it on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/DeenGames).
