# Our Values

Deen Games is a simple group with a simple goal: to earn the pleasure of Allah, through the creation of video games.

Our core values are:

- **Islam:** Above all else, we are Muslims, and we are subservient to our creator. We strive to do everything in His way, following the teachings He sent us through the Qur'an and the messenger Muhammad, salallahu alayhi wa sallam. This means we don't make games with music, for example.

- **Fun:** Games are meant to be fun and exciting. Our second goal is to make them just that. We don't want boring lessons packaged up as games; we want real, true fun games.

- **Connection:** Our final goal is to connect with players, through a story; something that catches you in and keep you playing. Games for just entertainment are not what we're after.

Finally, we work hard to make sure everything is within the acceptable framework of Islam. Sure, we don't put music in our games. But some games may have detailed, realistic people, while others might be faceless, and still others completely different.

We research different issues and consult with scholars to find out the right path. Because if it's not Islamic, it's not wanted here.

And that's Deen Games. We also occasionally post some interesting, development-centric information on [our wiki](http://sites.google.com/site/deengames). It may be outdated, though.
