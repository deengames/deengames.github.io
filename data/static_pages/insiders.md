### Why I Started an Insiders Membership Program

I've been creating games, mostly alone (or in really small teams) for the last decade. It's been a great start working on something I've dreamed of since I was a child. I achieved some incredible results, like creating a kids Android app with over 10k downloads.

But it isn't all fun and games. Over time, I realized that I run into the same problems again and again:

1) **We can only go so far if we're self-funded.** I've spent money on web-hosting, art, and other costs when needed. Without funds, we can only go so far. We can only make games that don't require a lot of in-game content or fancy graphics; we can't publish to Steam or the app store; and we can't invest in really good-quality art and audio make our projects accessible to a wider audience.

2) **We need to make Deen Games self-sustainable for this to work.** Creating games takes a really long time and a ton of work. While I love creating games and pour my free time into it, the day only has so many hours, and we make slow progress. (And it's really tough to make a buck in the gaming industry without making "pay-to-win" games or resorting to ads. We don't want to do that.)

Keeping our games free (and open-source) is part of our core values. We strive to create games that are enjoyable and fun, not ad-riddled games that are optimized to empty your wallet. You can find our projects [here on GitHub](https://github.com/deengames).

Long-term, I plan to working on game development full time. This is already a full-time job -- it requires coordinating development work, marketing, blogging about game design and development, and outreach, which is not to say anything actually writing code and making awesome games!

It's a lot for one person to handle on top of other responsibilities like work. When I can work on this full time, I will be able to spend 4-7 times (or more) as much time on this.

That's where Gumroad comes into the picture. You can be a part of our wonderful membership website in exchange for some awesome benefits. You can unsubscribe at any time.
