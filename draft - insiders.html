      <h3>What is the Insiders program?</h3>
<p>The insiders program is a paid membership program powered by Gumroad. Subscribers get some sweet, exclusive rewards based on how much they want to pay. You can subscribe here:</p>

<h3>Why I Started an Insiders Membership Program</h3>
<p>I've been creating games, mostly alone (or in really small teams) for the last decade. It's been a great start working on something I've dreamed of since I was a child. I achieved some incredible results, like creating a kids Android app with over 10k downloads.</p>
<p>But it isn't all fun and games. Over time, I realized that I run into the same problems again and again:</p>
<p>1) <strong>We can only go so far if we're self-funded.</strong> I've spent money on web-hosting, art, and other costs when needed. Without funds, we can only go so far. We can only make games that don't require a lot of in-game content or fancy graphics; we can't publish to Steam or the app store; and we can't invest in really good-quality art and audio make our projects accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>2) <strong>We need to make Deen Games self-sustainable for this to work.</strong> Creating games takes a really long time and a ton of work. While I love creating games and pour my free time into it, the day only has so many hours, and we make slow progress. (And it's really tough to make a buck in the gaming industry without making "pay-to-win" games or resorting to ads. We don't want to do that.)</p>
<p>Keeping our games free (and open-source) is part of our core values. We strive to create games that are enjoyable and fun, not ad-riddled games that are optimized to empty your wallet. You can find our projects <a href="https://github.com/deengames">here on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Long-term, I plan to working on game development full time. This is already a full-time job -- it requires coordinating development work, marketing, blogging about game design and development, and outreach, which is not to say anything actually writing code and making awesome games!</p>
<p>It's a lot for one person to handle on top of other responsibilities like work. When I can work on this full time, I will be able to spend 4-7 times (or more) as much time on this.</p>
<p>That's where Gumroad comes into the picture. You can be a part of our wonderful membership website in exchange for some awesome benefits. You can unsubscribe at any time.</p>
<h3>What is Gumroad?</h3>
<p>Gumroad is an exciting platform that connects content creators to their fans. Creators can connect to their fans and provide exclusive benefits, such as early access to games. In exchange, fans can support their favourite creators with as little or as much as they want to pay per month.</p>
<p>In exchange for your monthly membership fee, you get to be part of our awesome insider community. In addition to getting an exclusive access channel to give us your feedback, it includes some pretty slick rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://gum.co/gdtY">Check out the subscription tiers</a> see what we're offering right now. (These may change from time to time.)</p>
<p>If you have any questions, concerns, comments, etc. feel free to <a href="mailto:nightbladecodes@gmail.com">send me an email</a>. I'll be happy to hear from you.</p>
<p>Our games will remain permanently free (and open-source).</p>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this. We look forward in anticipation to working with you to create some awesome stuff in the future.</p>
